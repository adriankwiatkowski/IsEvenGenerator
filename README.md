# isevengenerator
Simple "is even" method generator.
Standard libraries don't have functions to check if number is even, so I decided to generate one. It works only for positive numbers, but can be easily modified to support all cases.

Size of generated file is slightly less than 90 GB.

# I go inspired to generate this useful method when I saw a picture on the internet. I didn't want to write this long "is even" function in a future by myself, so I decided to write a generator that will do it for me.
